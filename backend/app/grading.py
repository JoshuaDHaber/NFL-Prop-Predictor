"""Grading the board: snapshot every pick before kickoff, then score it against the box score.

The backtest checks projections against results, but never against the sportsbook lines, so it can't say whether the
model beats the market or how much to trust it. This log can: each NFL sync snapshots the priced picks for games
still to kick off (the last snapshot before a game is the one graded), and each model run grades finished games from
nflverse's weekly stats, which it has just loaded anyway.
