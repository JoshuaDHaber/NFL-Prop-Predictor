"""Blowout probability: the chance an NBA game ends with a final margin of `threshold` points or more, either way.

History comes from ESPN: each date's scoreboard (finished games and scores) and each game's odds (the pregame spread
and total, the median across the books ESPN lists, in-game lines left out). The raw responses run to hundreds of MB, so
they aren't cached; the parsed games are kept in one small CSV (HISTORY_CSV) and later runs fetch only the dates after
its last game. A first run over eight seasons makes about 12,000 requests (two to three minutes).

Model (walk-forward over 2021-22 to 2025-26, each season fitted on the ones before it):
- The home margin is Student-t around the market's spread: the margin's tails are fatter than a normal curve's
  (2.5-sigma misses happen 1.8% of the time, not 1.2%), which matters most at 25+ and 30+.
- Its scale depends on |spread|, quadratically: pick'ems and big spreads miss by more than 3-6 point lines do.
  The total added nothing once the spread was in.
- The scale is then rescaled by how far the last RECENT_GAMES games missed their lines: blowouts have grown (games
  decided by 20+: 16-19% a season from 2019 to 2023, 22.8% in 2025-26), and the rescale follows that drift. Weighting
  recent seasons more did not.
P(|margin| >= t) is the sum of the two tails.
