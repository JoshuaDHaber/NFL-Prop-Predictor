"""Projection model for rushing, receiving and passing yards, receptions, passing TDs and longest reception.

yards = volume (carries | targets) x efficiency (yds/carry | yds/target)
receptions = targets x catch rate (the same machinery, with receptions in place of yards)
passing TDs = attempts x TD rate (the same again), scaled by the points the lines expect the team to score
longest reception = the expected best of the projected catches, each drawn from the league's catch-yardage shape
  (play-by-play, by position) stretched to the player's yards per catch (see long_table)
  * volume: exponentially recency-weighted average, shrunk toward a low prior
  * efficiency: recency-weighted, heavily shrunk toward the position mean
  * opponent: shrunk yards-allowed-per-game factor vs. league average
  * game script: team spread nudges rush volume up (favorites) / pass volume down
  * weather: at outdoor stadiums, wind and cold scale yardage by factors fitted on the backtest (engine/weather.py)
The spread and shape of outcomes come from the walk-forward backtest of this same model: the typical error
(a robust spread, binned by projection size) and the empirical distribution of standardized errors. So the
chance of beating a line matches how often actual yardage beat the projection, including skew and blow-up
games. (Older runs used an assumed gamma curve, kept as a fallback in prob_over_under.)
