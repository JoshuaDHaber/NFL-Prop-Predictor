"""Team moneyline: each team's chance to win, priced against the sportsbooks' moneylines.

Ratings are a ridge regression of every recent game's point margin on (home rating - away rating + home field),
recency-weighted (HALFLIFE weeks, and earlier seasons count PRIOR_SEASON as much). A predicted margin becomes a win
probability with a normal curve whose spread (sigma) is fitted on a walk-forward backtest.

Checked against closing moneylines the ratings are a weak signal: better than always picking the home team, but the
market is sharper, and no blend in the backtest beat the market alone. So a moneyline price always leans at least
ML_MIN_MARKET_WEIGHT on the market's no-vig chance, whatever the "trust market" slider says (as anytime TD does).
