"""Reading the market: the margin stripped with the power method, a consensus that leans on the books that lead the
close, the market's whole distribution read off an alternate-line ladder, and how much to trust the market against
the model, fitted on graded picks.

Power devig. Splitting the margin in proportion to each side's price (p / (p + q)) leaves the favorite-longshot bias
in: books shade longshots more than favorites, so the proportional split overrates the longshot. The power method
finds k with p**k + q**k = 1 and takes p**k: the same answer at even prices, a smaller longshot chance otherwise.

Book weights. Some books post their own numbers and others follow. A book whose early price already sits where the
market closes is one the others move toward, so each book is scored on how far its quotes 6+ hours before the close
were from the close of every other book at the same line (fit_book_weights), and the consensus averages books by that
score. Books owned by one company post the same lines, so they share one voice (TWINS).
