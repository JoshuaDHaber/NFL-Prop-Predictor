        <h3>How to read this</h3>
        <p>
          Every historical game from last season onward was projected using only data available before kickoff
          (a walk-forward backtest). MAE is the average miss in yards (catches for receptions); bias is average (actual − projection), so
          near zero means the projections are not systematically high or low. The same residuals are used to fit
          the spread of outcomes behind every win probability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The backtest tests accuracy, not profitability — there is no historical odds data in it (the graded picks above are). Treat large
          edges against sharp markets with suspicion; they usually mean the model is missing context.
